The eyes of the global high-tech industry are set on the most unexpected of places today.

The crime-ridden town of Ashford, Wyoming, home of less than 500 people, became the first place on Earth to replace their emergency service vehicles with completely autonomous counterparts.

The shocking announcement, made during the dryest summer in history, exploded on social media, with the apocalyptic #ASHESford going viral.

Ashford’s mayor Zachary Bribesman stated the town “has never been in better hands”, before stepping into a private jet holding two cash briefcases.

With their future unclear, the people of Ashford prepare for the worst, and hope for the best.
