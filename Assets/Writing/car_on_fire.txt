The car's on fire!
That car's burning!
How is it burning?!
It's gonna blow! Run!
Stop it before it blows!
Call 911 and book it!
Call 911, now!
Where are the firefighters?!
My car!
Dad's car!
Ma's car!
My truck!
My pickup!
My SUV!
My convertable!
My dune buggy!
My tractor!
My beetle!
Is that your car?
Isn't that our car?
Do you smell oil?
Stay away from that!
Get away!
Is it gonna explode?
Out, honey, now!
Run for it!
It'll reach the fuel tank!
*fuel dangerously burning*
*fast and furious crackling*
