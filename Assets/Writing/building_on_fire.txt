Fire!
Run for it!
Holy crap! RUN!
Is this arson?
What started it?!
A fire? This early?!
It's burning! Call 911!
The place is on fire!
Can we stop it?
It's gonna spread!
It's not gonna last long!
It's gonna collapse!
It won't blow, right?!
I can't breathe!
Let's get outta here!
So much smoke...
My house is burning!
My house!
That house is on fire!
My friend's house!
My grandma's house!
The school!
The Pizza place!
The burger joint!
The supermarket!
The diner!
My favorite resturant!
The glue factory!
The farm!
My dad's farm!
The dental clinic!
The sheriff's office!
The repair shop!
The garage!
The block is on fire!
*crackles*
*ferocious crackling*
*slowly degrading materials*
