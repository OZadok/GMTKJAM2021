Fire!
Run for it!
Holy crap! RUN!
Is this arson?
What started it?!
A fire? This early?!
It's burning!
Place is on fire!
Can we stop it?
It's gonna spread!
It's gonna collapse!
I can't breathe!
So much smoke...
My house is burning!
My house!
My friend's house!
My ma's house!
The school!
The Pizza place!
The burger joint!
The supermarket!
The diner!
My fav resturant!
The glue factory!
The farm!
My dad's farm!
The dental clinic!
The garage!
The block is burning!
*crackles*
*ferocious crackling*
*degrading materials*
*strained coughing*
