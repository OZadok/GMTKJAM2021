Serves you right!
Yeah, you deserve it!
Suck on that karma!
Karma, suckers!
Justice at last!
Justice!
You're gonna burn alright!
There's more in hell!
Get out of my town!
Outta this town, scum!
Mom, the bad guy's burning!
Dad, that thief is on fire!
Gimme some of that popcorn...
Maybe fires ain't so bad...
At least crime's gone...
That's one way to do it...
